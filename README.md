# Day 1
## 30th of July
Our college induction program started with **a peaceful visit to the Gurdwara Sahib** inside the GNDEC campus. **The structure of the Gurdwara is shaped like a ship**, which made us feel like we were **starting our journey in the Jahaz of Waheguru**. First, the **Japji Sahib** path was recited, and then beautiful shabads were sung by the Kirtani Jatha, including:
- Hey Govind Hey Gopal
- Gur Ramdas Rakho Sharnayi
- Tum Maat-Pita Hum Balak Tere
- Sunder Sobha Lal Gopal Dayaal Ki
  <br> This session gave us a calm and spiritual feeling. After the kirtan, we were served tea and snacks, and then we moved towards the auditorium.
Outside the auditorium, we received our welcome kits, and after a short wait inside, the program began. **Harpreet Ma’am, our HOD of Applied Sciences**, gave a warm welcome and a motivational message to all of us. Then,**Principal Sir** shared the achievements of GNDEC and encouraged us to take every opportunity seriously in our college life.<br>
**The chief guest, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Ex-Cabinet Minister and trustee of Nankana Sahib Education Trust**, gave an inspiring speech. He talked about the values of discipline, having a clear purpose, and the founders' vision behind the college.
After a small break, our student volunteers took us to our respective departments. We got to meet our teachers, visit the labs, and understand more about the college environment.

### Visit to Workshops
On the sixth day of the induction program, students were taken on a **visit to various workshops** to gain practical exposure to engineering tools, machinery, and processes.<br>
I visited the **Welding Workshop**, where I learned about the basic principles of welding, different types of welding processes and the importance of welding in manufacturing and construction.<br>
The instructors demonstrated how *two metal pieces are joined by heating them to their melting point and using filler material* to create a strong joint. Safety precautions such as wearing welding helmets, gloves, and protective clothing were also emphasized to prevent injuries from sparks and intense light.<br>
The visit provided valuable insight into the practical applications of welding in real-world engineering projects and its role in producing durable, high-quality metal structures.

**Conclusion:**
The welding workshop visit helped me understand the technical and safety aspects of welding, and gave me hands-on exposure to one of the most important skills in the manufacturing industry.
