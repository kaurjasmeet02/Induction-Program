# Day 1
## 30th of July
Our college induction program started with **a peaceful visit to the Gurdwara Sahib** inside the GNDEC campus. **The structure of the Gurdwara is shaped like a ship**, which made us feel like we were **starting our journey in the Jahaz of Waheguru**. First, the **Japji Sahib** path was recited, and then beautiful shabads were sung by the Kirtani Jatha, including:
- Hey Govind Hey Gopal
- Gur Ramdas Rakho Sharnayi
- Tum Maat-Pita Hum Balak Tere
- Sunder Sobha Lal Gopal Dayaal Ki
  <br> This session gave us a calm and spiritual feeling. After the kirtan, we were served tea and snacks, and then we moved towards the auditorium.
Outside the auditorium, we received our welcome kits, and after a short wait inside, the program began. **Harpreet Ma’am, our HOD of Applied Sciences**, gave a warm welcome and a motivational message to all of us. Then,**Principal Sir** shared the achievements of GNDEC and encouraged us to take every opportunity seriously in our college life.<br>
**The chief guest, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Ex-Cabinet Minister and trustee of Nankana Sahib Education Trust**, gave an inspiring speech. He talked about the values of discipline, having a clear purpose, and the founders' vision behind the college.
After a small break, our student volunteers took us to our respective departments. We got to meet our teachers, visit the labs, and understand more about the college environment.
