# My Experience @GNDEC

_______________________

# Day 1
## 30th of July
Our college induction program started with a peaceful visit to the Gurdwara Sahib inside the GNDEC campus. The structure of the Gurdwara is shaped like a ship, which made us feel like we were starting our journey in the Jahaz of Waheguru. First, the Japji Sahib path was recited, and then beautiful shabads were sung by the Kirtani Jatha, including:
- Hey Govind Hey Gopal
- Gur Ramdas Rakho Sharnayi
- Tum Maat-Pita Hum Balak Tere
- Sunder Sobha Lal Gopal Dayaal Ki
  <br> This session gave us a calm and spiritual feeling. After the kirtan, we were served tea and snacks, and then we moved towards the auditorium.
Outside the auditorium, we received our welcome kits, and after a short wait inside, the program began. Harpreet Ma’am, our HOD of Applied Sciences, gave a warm welcome and a motivational message to all of us. Then, Principal Sir shared the achievements of GNDEC and encouraged us to take every opportunity seriously in our college life.<br>
The chief guest, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Ex-Cabinet Minister and trustee of Nankana Sahib Education Trust, gave an inspiring speech. He talked about the values of discipline, having a clear purpose, and the founders' vision behind the college.
After a small break, our student volunteers took us to our respective departments. We got to meet our teachers, visit the labs, and understand more about the college environment.

# Day 2 
## 1st of August
The second day began with Harpreet Ma’am guiding us through a short meditation session, asking us to close our eyes and remember the God we believe in. After that, a student was invited to recite the Mool Mantar, and we all joined in, creating a calm and peaceful start to the day.<br>
Next, Dr. Priya Darshani Ma’am delivered a session on Universal Human Values and helped us to explore our aspirations and concerns.<br>
Later, Dr. Arvind Dhingra Sir gave a fun and motivating speech. He also called some students to play a simple game. I also got a chance to participate, and it was a really fun experience! The winning team received chocolates, which made the session enjoyable.<br>
After the break, we appeared for our proficiency test, officially beginning our academic journey.

# Day 3
## 4th of August
The third day began with a calm and spiritual start. Harpreet Ma’am asked me to recite the Mool Mantar in front of everyone. It felt special to lead the recitation, and all the students joined in, creating a peaceful environment.<br>
After that, we had an expert session by the Causmic Club, which functions under the Department of Applied Sciences. The Causmic Club is a student-led initiative that promotes creativity, communication skills, and confidence through events like debates, poetry, art, singing, and more. It also organizes the well-known inter-college fest GNE’s ACME, where students from different colleges participate and compete.<br>
In the session, the club members introduced us to GitHub, explaining what it is used for and guiding us through how to sign up and create an account — a helpful session for beginners.<br>
Later, Priya Darshani Ma’am gave another lecture on Universal Human Values, helping us relate them to our daily life.<br>
After the break, I attended my first college lectures — one in English, and the other in P2P, where we were introduced to the basics of the C++ language. It was an exciting start to the academic side of college.
